This is side project for me about discontinous galerkin method. The goal is implementing simple relativistic hydrodynamics code in DG. Most of the codes will be written in Matlab first for testing then will be updated in other codes that are suitable for HPC.

The references came mostly from a book : Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods, Algorithms, Analysis , and Applications by Jan S. Hesthaven and Tim Warburton.
